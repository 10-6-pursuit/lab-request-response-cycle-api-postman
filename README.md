# Request Response Cycle, APIs, and Postman Lab

You will be working with a free API of your choice for this lab.

## Getting Started

1. Choose an API with no auth and no CORS from the following list. It _should not_ be one that you've already seen or worked on in class.
   - [Public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)
1. Choose an API not covered in your readings, class, or other assignments. The API should be new to you.
1. Write your answers in this README.md file. Do not delete the questions. Write your answers after the `>`. If you need to write more than one paragraph, add more `>`.
1. Take the time to read back the work, and edit what you've written so that your answers are clear and anyone reading it can easily understand what you've written.
